# What is this project?

This is a landing page website for a local ship that you can get tours on. The ship is the William G. Mather. The Mather is a ship owned by the Great Lakes Science Center. There is already an offical website for the William G. Mather. You can find that link [here](http://greatscience.com/explore/exhibits/william-g-mather-steamship).

I am doing this project as a way to create a landing page specific for this ship. I am going to use royalty free images from Pexels and Unsplash. The images will not be of the actual ship. This is purely a personal project meant to practice. The information I am getting on the ship will be from this website.
